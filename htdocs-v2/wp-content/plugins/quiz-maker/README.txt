With our Quiz Maker plugin it's easy to make a quiz in a short time. Just follow a few simple steps to create online quizzes. What you need to do first is to make questions and then include them in your quiz. You are free to choose the types of questions. Those are the following:

**Radio**, which is the single choice with one right answer.
**Checkbox**, which is also the multiple choice but it can include several right answers.
**Dropdown**, which is the same single choice with one right answer, but it occupies less place.
**Text**, which is the text input for typing the answer. You can provide right answer from the dashboard.
**Number**, which is the same text type, but the user can type only numbers in it.

This plugin allows you to make an unlimited number of quizzes. Each QUIZ can include unlimited questions. Questions can be a single choice, multiple-choice, dropdown, text and number. The plugin is very ** user-friendly** and **easy to use**. With this WordPress questionnaire plugin you can also categorize the **questions and quizzes**.

== WordPress Quiz, Exam and Test maker plugin features ==


= Creating a simple quiz =

For creating simple quiz you need to follow these steps:
- Add questions from Questions page
- Add quiz from Quizzes page and insert questions into the quiz
That's all.

To insert the Quiz into a Page, Post or text widget, copy shortcode [ays_quiz id='quiz_id'] and paste it at the desired place in the editor.

= Quiz settings =

There is a lot of settings in the quiz dashboard.
Here is the list of some quiz settings.

* Randomize questions  
* Randomize answers
* Question bank - Example: insert 100 questions in the quiz and then enable and set this option 20. Every time the plugin will get 20 questions from 100 randomly.
* Disable data storing in your database
* Intervals [PRO](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/quiz-maker/)  - show different messages according the user's score.


= Quiz with timer =

You can set a timer for your quiz and if the timer ends quiz will be submitted automatically. A quiz timer option is very useful for making an exam or test. So we can call it WordPress Exam plugin too. 


= Quiz results, scores and data form =

After successful completion of the quiz, you can track from your dashboard your visitors' results, duration, when they start and when they end the quiz.
We have created beautiful form and you can choose fields of the form from the dashboard and assign this form to your quiz ( After quiz or Before quiz ) and when the user finishes the quiz you can collect data and have beautiful statistics on your dashboard. This data allows you to create your email and SMS marketing, which will attract much more users from your specific target.
There are 3 static form fields in the free version` name, email and phone. For more custom fields you need to upgrade to the [PRO](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/quiz-maker/) version.
Also, results' statistics with graphs and export functionality available only in the Pro version.


= User report in the front-end =

You are free to choose what your visitors should see after completion of the **Quiz, Exam or Test**.
- Show progress bar with the percentage on the final step
- Show only percentage of result
- Show user mistakes on final page
- Show correct answers of each question (if the user selected wrong answer this question will be marked with red marker and when user selected right answer question will be marked with green marker)
In the Premium version there is a shortcode for registered users, which you can paste in users page for showing their history.

= Survey =

Using our plugin you can make a Survey too. We have made text and number question types and also "Not influence to the score" option.
It means that questions will not be counted for the final result. It stands as a survey plugin too. Also, you can make quiz and survey mix. You can enable the "Hide score" option from the quiz settings and you will just collect the data which users filled in the survey.
Check out the [Survey Demo](https://quiz-plugin.com/wordpress-quiz-plugin-free-demo/#ays-quiz-container-14).

= Quick Quiz =

We have created also another huge opportunity. You can create a quick quiz from the dashboard without visiting questions page or quiz page. Just click on a quick quiz button and you'll see a modal window with an opportunity to add questions and save the quiz, but note that it is only for adding a new quiz. For editing quiz you should do the steps as usually you edit quizzes or questions.

= Quiz themes, styles and live preview =

There is 6 themes available for making awesome quizzes.
You can choose one of them and then customize it with our 15+ style options (colors, backgrounds, borders). Also, there is a live preview feature in the style section in the dashboard, which allows the admin to see every change of options. There is no need to save and go to the front-end to see changes in styles. Have fun!

= Image questions and quiz =

WordPress Quiz plugin allows you to add images to your quiz and questions. Also, you can style your quiz to satisfy your visitors. 

= Quiz user restriction =

You can restrict your users by enabling and selecting user roles from the dashboard and only selected users with given roles can pass your quiz. If you don't want to restrict your quiz by role, we have created another opportunity for you, just enable **"Only for logged in users"** option and write some message to non-logged in users, by this way you can enlarge your community. If your quiz is interesting non-registered users will register on your website for passing the quiz and you will have ultra **traffic** on your website. Please note that by selecting restriction by user roles quiz will automatically select only for logged in users option.

= Quiz social sharing =

Also, users can share your quiz, test or exam in their social networks **(facebook, linkedin, twitter)**, which is important for your **SMM** and increase your **website traffic** and popularity.
