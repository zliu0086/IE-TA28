Create interactive images with clickable hotspots in WordPress. Perfect for floor plans and real estate photos, trade show booths, group photos, product features, annotated image tutorials, or any image map.

== Description ==

### New in 1.8: Improved interactive image rendering ###
We re-wrote the display of the plugin to use SVG for faster rendering of hotspots and better browser support

### Responsive Design ###
Interactive images resize to fit your theme and the available screen size

### Accessible ###
Image info is accessible to everyone who visits your site, regardless of device or capabilities.

### Progressively Enhanced ###
Your annotations & content are accessible even to users who have JavaScript disabled - SEO friendly too! Draw Attention uses canvas elements in modern browsers, and falls back to image maps in older browsers.

### Customizable Colors ###
Choose your own custom color scheme to match your site

### Highlight on Hover ###
Highlight different hotspot areas of your image when your site visitor moves their mouse over the interactive image

### Easy to Draw ###
Easy to draw the highlightable areas of your image - and easy to edit the shapes later too!

### More Info on Click ###
When a highlighted area is clicked, show more information. Great to highlight points of interest on your image.

### Go to a URL ###
Optionally send a site visitor to another URL when clicking highlightable hotspots on your image
